- *Regression*: When exporting to bibtex (with latex encoding) the "$" are missing
- bibparse should be more informative if the bibtex file is not well formatted

- Internally *always* use the generated key.
  The field "_code" is reserved for the original idenfier "key", if normalize is not True

- Make easier to change the rule for generating the internal key. Document it!

- If entry is present, give choice to:
  - Force replacing item
  - Update (merging keeping original. i.e.: modifying only fields non existing in the original)
  - Update (mergin keeping new version)
  - Do not add (current behavior)
