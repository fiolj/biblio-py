- *Regression*: When exporting to bibtex (with latex encoding) the "$" are missing
- bibparse should be more informative if the bibtex file is not well formatted

- Internally *always* use the generated key.
  The field "_code" is reserved for the original idenfier "key", if normalize is not True

- Make easier to change the rule for generating the internal key. Document it!
