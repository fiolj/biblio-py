  abstract = {When an atom is ionized by ion impact, the electron is ejected
           into a final continuum state of a two-centre potential due to the
           Coulomb fields of the projectile and ionized atom. The related
           effects on the electron yield or energy and angular distributions are
           referred to as two-centre electron emission (TCEE). The present
           report is devoted to a discussion of experimental and theoretical
           evidence of this TCEE. The use of heavy ions or antiprotons as
           projectiles allows to unravel these effects by monitoring the two
           centre potential.  On the theoretical side, the continuum distorted
           wave-eikonal initial state theory (CDW-EIS) accounts for the TCEE
           thus allowing a detailed interpretation of the experimental
           findings.},

  abstract = {When a strong attosecond laser pulse acts simultaneously with a
           fast ionic projectile, the electronic response of an atom changes and
           leads to a drastic change in the final momenta, which may be observed
           in recoil-ion momentum experiments. The nonlinear response to the
           combined fields leads in certain cases to ionization probabilities
           more than three times larger than the probabilities by either of the
           two fields individually. The results are based on an algorithm for
           accurate solution of the time-dependent Schr{\"o}dinger equation in
           three dimensions, which has the property that it requires CPU time
           comparable with that of two-dimensional methods.},

  abstract = { It is shown that the quantum force in the Bohmian formulation of
           quantum mechanics can be related to the stability properties of the
           given trajectory. In turn, the evolution of the stability properties
           is governed by higher order derivatives of the quantum potential,
           leading to an infinite hierarchy of coupled differential equations
           whose solution specifies completely all aspects of the
           dynamics. Neglecting derivatives of the quantum potential beyond a
           certain order allows truncation of the hierarchy, leading to
           approximate Bohmian trajectories. Use of the method in conjunction
           with Bohmian initial value formulations [J. Chem. Phys. 2003, 119,
           60] gives rise to simple position-space representations of
           observables or time correlation functions. These are analogous to
           approximate quasiclassical expressions based on the Wigner or Husimi
           phase space density but involve lower dimensional integrals with
           smoother integrands and avoid the costly evaluation of phase space
           transforms. The lowest-order version of the truncated hierarchy can
           capture large corrections to classical mechanical treatments and
           yields (with fewer trajectories) results that are somewhat more
           accurate than those based on quasiclassical phase space treatments.
