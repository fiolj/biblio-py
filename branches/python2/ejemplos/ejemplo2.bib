    energy loss of Li ions in Zn, on a wide range of energies,
    together with comparative studies for H and He ions on the same
    target. By using Zn films and the Rutherford backscattering
    technique, we were able to determine the stopping power for Li
    ions in the (0.3 to 5) MeV energy interval. The experimental
    results cover an energy range which includes the maximum of the
    stopping power. The values obtained agree well with previous
    measurements performed in a limited energy interval and with the
    semiempirical code SRIM 2006. On the other hand, we have performed
    ab initio theoretical calculations based on the extended Friedel
    sum rule transport cross section formulation for the valence
    electrons and the shellwise local plasma approximation for the
    inner shells. This theoretical description reproduces reasonably
    well the experimental results on the whole studied energy range.
    The same occurs with previous measurements performed with H and He
    on the same target. The importance of the screened potential on
    the stopping power due to the valence electrons is stressed in the

  abstract = {The role of the description of initial and final states in ({\mbox{$\gamma$}},2e) and
    high incident energy (e,3e) collisions with helium targets is
    investigated. We describe the double continuum as a product of
    plane waves modulated by three Coulomb distortion factors and
    propose different sets of initial states which satisfy exactly all
    two-body Kato cusp conditions. Wave functions with only angular
    correlation, and with both angular and radial correlation, are
    considered; in each case, the interparticle correlation factors
    are such that they have different (polynomial, exponentially
    increasing or decreasing, and oscillatory) asymptotic behaviors.
    The gauge discrepancies observed in ({\mbox{$\gamma$}},2e) calculations show that
    the overall agreement with absolute (e,3e) experimental data at
    10+10eV ejected energy obtained with simple initial states is
    fortuitous and can hardly be attributed to a balanced description
    with respect to the final state. Thus the description of the final
    state by the product of plane waves and three Coulomb distortion
    factors is not suitable to describe sufficiently well the double
    continuum of two electrons ejected at 10 eV. An investigation of
    the ejected energy dependence on both double ionization processes
    further illustrates that what is observed at 10+10eV ejected
    energy does not necessarily hold at higher values. Further
    theoretical studies and new experimental data are clearly needed

    The small parameter in the power series expansion of the time-

    drive the system{'}s Hamiltonian from the initial to its final
    form. We review other standard perturbative and nonperturbative
    ways of going beyond the adiabatic approximation, extending and
    finding exact relations among them, and also compare the
    efficiency of those methods against the APT. Most importantly, we
    determine APT corrections to the Berry phase by use of the
    Aharonov- Anandan geometric phase. We then solve several time-
    dependent problems, allowing us to illustrate that the APT is the
    only perturbative method that gives the right corrections to the
    adiabatic approximation. Finally, we propose an experiment to
    measure the APT corrections to the Berry phase and show, for a

  abstract = {Molecular hydrogen adsorption between two Li, K-doped coronene
    molecules (taken as local environment of carbon microporous

    These cluster calculations are complemented with periodic DFT-
    LDA/GGA calculations on extended Li- and K-doped structures. In
    all cases, energy minimization calculations unravel that there is
    a stable adsorption site for molecular hydrogen in these Li- and
    K-doped sp$^{2}$ carbon structures with large adsorption energies.
    This is the direct consequence of the significant charge transfer
    from the doping agents on neighboring slab carbon atoms, which
    allows the coupling of the molecular H$_{2}$ polarizability with
    the resulting substrate electric field (polarization interaction)
    that in turn induces the stabilization of molecular hydrogen.
    These calculations also give an insight on the atomic

    resonances which are met when {\mbox{$\omega$}} sime N{\mbox{$\Omega$}}, where N is an integer,
    have been studied for the n = 25 shell of Li. Coherent elliptic
    states were prepared and used as initial states, and the dynamics
    was probed by the probability P$_{a}$ for the atom to remain in
    the initial state. The harmonic field \vec{E}_\Omega was
    circularly polarized and had constant amplitude, and the slow
    field varied such that {\mbox{$\omega$}} at first decreased, then went through a
    minimum and finally increased to bring the atoms into resonance at
    two different times. This led to interference patterns in
    P$_{a}$({\mbox{$\omega$}}$_{0}$), where {\mbox{$\omega$}}$_{0}$ is the minimum splitting. These
    were quite regular for coherent elliptic states of low
    eccentricity e and for strong fields \vec{E}_\Omega, but less
    regular for large e and weak \vec{E}_\Omega. A few states of Li(n

    (1s)$^{2}$ core. Without quantum defects the dynamics can be
    reduced to that of two spin-\case{1}{2} particles and this
    reproduces the regular patterns quite well. A full quantal

  abstract = {In this work we present a theoretical study of the single ionization
    process involved in collisions of protons on He, Li, and Be
    targets at 2MeV/amu projectile impact energy. Fully differential
    cross sections (FDCSs) are calculated within a continuum distorted
    wave method. Three different potentials are used to represent the
    interaction between the low energy outgoing electron and the
    residual ion target. Two of them are based on Coulomb potentials
    with proper effective charges for the target, while the other
    relies in a Garvey-type potential. These procedures provide
    remarkable differences in the binary and recoil peak regions, for
    the Li and Be cases. On the other hand, He target calculations
    lead to qualitative agreement for the three FDCSs at the momentum
    transfers and emission energies here considered. These results
    manifest the complexity of the ionization process for
    multielectronic targets and emphasize the importance of choosing
    an adequate model potential to describe the emitted electron
    dynamics in ionizing collisions.},

  abstract = {Transition amplitudes and probabilities are the basic quantities of
    numerous theoretical approaches for the interpretation of
    collisional processes. These quantities are often evaluated from
    the transition matrix via Fourier transformation. However, a
    modification of the axial symmetry of the collision has sometimes
    been introduced to simplify the calculation. The present study
    shows that such a simplification is in general not justified and a
    source of highly unrealistic results. This is demonstrated in
    studies of single and double ionization of helium by ion impact.},
