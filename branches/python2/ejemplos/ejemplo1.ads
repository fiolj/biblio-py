%B Molecular hydrogen adsorption between two Li, K-doped coronene molecules
(taken as local environment of carbon microporous materials) is studied
by first-principles DFT-B3LYP calculations. These cluster calculations
are complemented with periodic DFT-LDA/GGA calculations on extended Li-
and K-doped structures. In all cases, energy minimization calculations
unravel that there is a stable adsorption site for molecular hydrogen in
these Li- and K-doped sp<SUP>2</SUP> carbon structures with large
adsorption energies. This is the direct consequence of the significant
charge transfer from the doping agents on neighboring slab carbon atoms,
which allows the coupling of the molecular H<SUB>2</SUB> polarizability
with the resulting substrate electric field (polarization interaction)
that in turn induces the stabilization of molecular hydrogen. These
calculations also give an insight on the atomic configurations of
interlayer species (H<SUB>2</SUB> and Li/K) as the interlayer spacing
increases. It can be shown that large positional changes correlate with
electronic properties of interlayer species. The confined hydrogen
molecule does not show any tendency for dissociation and adopts a
position in the interlayer void that is deeply related to that of doping
ions.

%B We have measured electron emission for transfer ionization (TI) and
total electron emission (TEE, all emission processes) for 100 keV
amu<SUP>-1</SUP> He<SUP>2+</SUP> on He and H<SUB>2</SUB> targets. Double
differential cross sections have been obtained for emission angles
θ = 0°, 20° and 45°, and electron energies ranging
from 2 to 300 eV. Pure ionization, mainly due to single ionization,
dominates the low-energy electron emission. The main observed structure
in the electron spectra, a cusp centred at θ = 0° and at a
speed equal to that of the incident projectile, presents an asymmetric
shape. This is in contrast to the symmetric shape observed by us at 25
keV amu<SUP>-1</SUP> for the same collision systems, suggesting a change
in the cusp formation mechanism for TI within this energy range.

%B The recent observation of a pressure-induced insulator to metal (I-M)
transition in pure LaMnO<SUB>3</SUB> [I. Loa , Phys. Rev. Lett. 87,
125501 (2001).PRLTAO0031-900710.1103/PhysRevLett.87.125501], opens the
way to a study of the role of the orbital degrees of freedom on the
electronic structure in a stoichiometric material and its interaction
with lattice distortion. To obtain the energy of the system, we resort
to a slave boson description for the electronic part and add an elastic
term associated to the Jahn-Teller distortion. We obtain the evolution
of the electronic structure and the Jahn-Teller distortion with
pressure. We find that the Jahn-Teller distortion does not vanish before
entering the metallic phase, that the gap closes with pressure in a way
similar to that indicated by the temperature dependence of the
conductivity, and that both Coulomb and Jahn-Teller interactions are
necessary to describe appropriately the phase transition in
LaMnO<SUB>3</SUB>.

%B Rydberg atoms of principal quantum number n in a superposition of a
harmonic and a slowly varying field pass through several resonances with
the harmonic field of frequency Ω as the splitting ω of the
shell by the slow field varies. These transient resonances which are met
when ω sime NΩ, where N is an integer, have been studied for
the n = 25 shell of Li. Coherent elliptic states were prepared and used
as initial states, and the dynamics was probed by the probability
P<SUB>a</SUB> for the atom to remain in the initial state. The harmonic
field \vec{E}_\Omega  was circularly polarized and had constant
amplitude, and the slow field varied such that ω at first
decreased, then went through a minimum and finally increased to bring
the atoms into resonance at two different times. This led to
interference patterns in P<SUB>a</SUB>(ω<SUB>0</SUB>), where
ω<SUB>0</SUB> is the minimum splitting. These were quite regular
for coherent elliptic states of low eccentricity e and for strong fields
\vec{E}_\Omega , but less regular for large e and weak \vec{E}_\Omega .
A few states of Li(n = 25) are not hydrogenic due to quantum defects
from the (1s)<SUP>2</SUP> core. Without quantum defects the dynamics can
be reduced to that of two spin-\case{1}{2}  particles and this
reproduces the regular patterns quite well. A full quantal treatment,
which is required if quantum defects are important, shows that the more
irregular patterns are the result of quite complex dynamics involving
non-hydrogenic quasi-eigenstates.

%B We employ different theoretical models, both classical and
quantum-mechanical, to explore the recoil-ion momentum distribution in
positron atom collisions. We pay special attention to the vicinity of
the kinematical threshold between ionization and positronium formation.
We demonstrate that it is intertwined by dynamical constraints to the
formation of highly excited and low-lying continuum electron positron
states. Finally we discuss how the study of recoil-ion momentum
distribution, which is characteristic of a reaction microscopy
technique, might represent an alternative approach to the standard
spectroscopy of electrons and positrons.
