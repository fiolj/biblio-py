<h1>BibTeX (mainly from wikipedia)</h1>

<h2 name="bibtexformat">Description</h2> BibTeX is a program and file format designed by Oren
  Patashnik and Leslie Lamport in 1985 for
  the <a href="http://tex.loria.fr/english/index.html">LaTeX</a>
  document preparation system.  The format is entirely character based, so
  it can be used by any program (although the standard character set for accents
  is TeX). It is field (tag) based and the BibTeX program will ignore unknown
  fields, so it is expandable. It is probably the most common format for
  bibliographies on the Internet.

<p>The BibTeX program uses style files, a list of citations from LaTeX, and a
BibTeX database to create a LaTeX file listing the cited references. The idea of
style files is that a final copy in any journal-specific form can be done
automatically.
</p>

<h2>Bibliographic information file</h2>

BibTeX uses a style-independent text-based file format for lists of bibliography items, such as articles, books, theses. BibTeX bibliography files usually end in <code>.bib</code>.</p>
<p>Bibliography entries each contain some subset of standard data entries:</p>

<ul>
<li><tt>address</tt>: Publisher's address (usually just the city, but can be the full address for lesser-known publishers)</li>

<li><tt>annote</tt>: An annotation for annotated bibliography styles (not typical)</li>
<li><tt>author</tt>: The name(s) of the author(s) (in the case of more than one author, separated by <tt>and</tt>)</li>
<li><tt>booktitle</tt>: The title of the book, if only part of it is being cited</li>
<li><tt>chapter</tt>: The chapter number</li>
<li><tt>crossref</tt>: The key of the cross-referenced entry</li>

<li><tt>edition</tt>: The edition of a book, long form (such as "first" or "second")</li>
<li><tt>editor</tt>: The name(s) of the editor(s)</li>
<li><tt>eprint</tt>: A specification of an electronic publication, often a preprint or a technical report</li>
<li><tt>howpublished</tt>: How it was published, if the publishing method is nonstandard</li>
<li><tt>institution</tt>: The institution that was involved in the publishing, but not necessarily the publisher</li>
<li><tt>journal</tt>: The journal or magazine the work was published in</li>

<li><tt>key</tt>: A hidden field used for specifying or overriding the alphabetical order of entries (when the "author" and "editor" fields are missing). Note that this is very different from the key (mentioned just after this list) that is used to cite or cross-reference the entry.</li>
<li><tt>month</tt>: The month of publication (or, if unpublished, the month of creation)</li>
<li><tt>note</tt>: Miscellaneous extra information</li>
<li><tt>number</tt>: The "number" of a journal, magazine, or tech-report, if applicable. (Most publications have a "volume", but no "number" field.)</li>
<li><tt>organization</tt>: The conference sponsor</li>
<li><tt>pages</tt>: Page numbers, separated either by commas or double-hyphens. For books, the total number of pages.</li>

<li><tt>publisher</tt>: The publisher's name</li>
<li><tt>school</tt>: The school where the thesis was written</li>
<li><tt>series</tt>: The series of books the book was published in (e.g. "Lecture Notes in Computer Science")</li>
<li><tt>title</tt>: The title of the work</li>
<li><tt>type</tt>: The type of tech-report, for example, "Research Note"</li>

<li><tt>url</tt>: The WWW address</li>
<li><tt>volume</tt>: The volume of a journal or multi-volume book</li>
<li><tt>year</tt>: The year of publication (or, if unpublished, the year of creation)</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, each entry contains a key that is used to cite or cross-reference the entry. This key is the first item in a BibTeX entry, and is not part of any field.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<pre>
@article{Gettys90,
   author = {Jim Gettys and Phil Karlton and Scott McGregor},
   title = {The {X} Window System, Version 11},
   journal = {Software Practice and Experience},
   volume = {20},
   number = {S2},
   year = {1990},
   abstract = {A technical overview of the X11 functionality.  This is an update
of the X10 TOG paper by Scheifler \&amp; Gettys.}
}
</pre>

<h2>Format Description</h2>

<h3>Special features</h3>

  The <tt>@STRING</tt> command is used to define abbreviations for use
by BibTeX.  The command
<tt>@string{jgg1 = "Journal of Gnats and Gnus, Series~1"}</tt>
defines 'jgg1' to be the abbreviation for the string "Journal of Gnats
and Gnus, Series~1".  Any reference outside of quotes or braces to
<tt>jgg1</tt> will be filled in with the full string.
<p>
  The <tt>@PREAMBLE</tt> command is used to define formatter code that will be
output directly to the <tt>bbl</tt> file produced by the BibTeX program.
This usually consists of LaTeX macros.  It is unclear what one should do
with the fields when converting to a format that does not use TeX.
</p><p>
  The <tt>@COMMENT</tt> command lets you put any text inside it.  It isn't
really necessary, since BibTeX will ignore any text that isn't inside an
entry.  However, you can not have an <b>@</b> character outside of an item.

<h3>Standard fields</h3>

<dl>

<dt name="address"><tt>address</tt>
</dt><dd>Usually the address of the <tt>publisher</tt> or other type of institution.
    For major publishing houses,
van Leunen recommends omitting the information entirely.
For small publishers, on the other hand, you can help the
reader by giving the complete address.

</dd><dt name="annote"><tt>annote</tt>
</dt><dd>An annotation.
It is not used by the standard bibliography styles,
but may be used by others that produce an annotated bibliography.

</dd><dt name="author"><tt>author</tt>
</dt><dd>The name(s) of the author(s),
in the format described in the LaTeX book.

</dd><dt name="booktitle"><tt>booktitle</tt>
</dt><dd>Title of a book, part of which is being cited.
See the LaTeX book for how to type titles.
For book entries, use the <tt>title</tt> field instead.

</dd><dt name="chapter"><tt>chapter</tt>
</dt><dd>A chapter (or section or whatever) number.

</dd><dt name="crossref"><tt>crossref</tt>
</dt><dd>The database key of the entry being cross referenced.  Any fields
that are missing from the current record are inherited from the field
being cross referenced.

</dd><dt name="edition"><tt>edition</tt>
</dt><dd>The edition of a book---for example, ``Second''.
This should be an ordinal, and
should have the first letter capitalized, as shown here;
the standard styles convert to lower case when necessary.

</dd><dt name="editor"><tt>editor</tt>
</dt><dd>Name(s) of editor(s), typed as indicated in the LaTeX book.
If there is also an <tt>author</tt> field, then
the <tt>editor</tt> field gives the editor of the book or collection
in which the reference appears.

</dd><dt name="howpublished"><tt>howpublished</tt>
</dt><dd>How something strange has been published.
The first word should be capitalized.

</dd><dt name="institution"><tt>institution</tt>
</dt><dd>The sponsoring institution of a technical report.

</dd><dt name="journal"><tt>journal</tt>
</dt><dd>A journal name.
Abbreviations are provided for many journals.

</dd><dt name="key"><tt>key</tt>
</dt><dd>Used for alphabetizing, cross referencing, and creating a label when
the ``author'' information
<!-- See odds-and-ends -->
is missing.
This field should not be confused with the key that appears in the
<tt>cite</tt> command and at the beginning of the database entry.

</dd><dt name="month"><tt>month</tt>
</dt><dd>The month in which the work was
published or, for an unpublished work, in which it was written.
You should use the standard three-letter abbreviation,
as described in Appendix B.1.3 of the LaTeX book.

</dd><dt name="note"><tt>note</tt>
</dt><dd>Any additional information that can help the reader.
The first word should be capitalized.

</dd><dt name="number"><tt>number</tt>
</dt><dd>The number of a journal, magazine, technical report,
or of a work in a series.
An issue of a journal or magazine is usually
identified by its volume and number;
the organization that issues a
technical report usually gives it a number;
and sometimes books are given numbers in a named series.

</dd><dt name="organization"><tt>organization</tt>
</dt><dd>The organization that sponsors a conference or that publishes
    a <tt>manual</tt>.

</dd><dt name="pages"><tt>pages</tt>
</dt><dd>One or more page numbers or range of numbers,
such as <tt>42--111</tt> or <tt>7,41,73--97</tt> or <tt>43+</tt>
(the `<tt>+</tt>' in this last example indicates pages following
that don't form a simple range).
To make it easier to maintain <cite>Scribe</cite>-compatible databases,
the standard styles convert a single dash (as in <tt>7-33</tt>)
to the double dash used in TeX to denote number ranges
(as in <tt>7--33</tt>).

</dd><dt name="publisher"><tt>publisher</tt>
</dt><dd>The publisher's name.

</dd><dt name="school"><tt>school</tt>
</dt><dd>The name of the school where a thesis was written.

</dd><dt name="series"><tt>series</tt>
</dt><dd>The name of a series or set of books.
When citing an entire book, the the <tt>title</tt> field
gives its title and an optional <tt>series</tt> field gives the
name of a series or multi-volume set
in which the book is published.

</dd><dt name="title"><tt>title</tt>
</dt><dd>The work's title, typed as explained in the LaTeX book.

</dd><dt name="type"><tt>type</tt>
</dt><dd>The type of a technical report---for example, ``Research Note''.

</dd><dt name="volume"><tt>volume</tt>
</dt><dd>The volume of a journal or multi-volume book.

</dd><dt name="year"><tt>year</tt>
</dt><dd>The year of publication or, for
an unpublished work, the year it was written.
Generally it should consist of four numerals, such as <tt>1984</tt>,
although the standard styles can handle any <tt>year</tt> whose
last four nonpunctuation characters are numerals,
such as `\hbox{(about 1984)}'.
