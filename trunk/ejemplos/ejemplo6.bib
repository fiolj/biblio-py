abstract = "
We investigate a proton-hydrogen model collision using a method based on the de Broglie-Bohm formulation of quantum dynamics. By studying the quantum-trajectories of the particles we obtain approximate ionization and capture cross sections that are in good agreement with the exact values. In particular, the implementation of this high-order approximation method allows us to solve each trajectory independently. The method has a relatively low computational cost and can be straightforwardly parallelized for many bodies systems."
